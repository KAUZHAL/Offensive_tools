# Offensive_tools
These are some of the tools I coded while watching Youtube videos based on use of python for ethical hacking.I consider them to be still under-development as many features can be added to them.
*Disclaimer: This tool is intended strictly for educational and ethical penetration testing purposes only.
Unauthorized access or usage against systems you do not own or have explicit permission to test is illegal and unethical.
The developer is not responsible for any misuse, damage, or legal consequences resulting from the use of this code.
Use responsibly.*
